Purpose
-------
This program mimics certain files from the Wiretap API for the Battleground Europe (BGE) MMOFPS by analyzing color data from pictures on the main BGE website. Hopefully, the mimicked data will allow programs that use the Wiretap API to display basic gamestate information even when the Wiretap API is down (which occurs fairly often).

Current Limitations:
 -> Can only export to two formats (XML/JSON).
 -> Limited configuration for deployment or installation.
 -> Very little error checking.
 -> No testing.

------------
Future Plans
------------
 -> Rewrite in a language I haven't learned yet.
  -> Java? Python? C#? Ruby? Javascript?
 -> Employ unit testing?
  -> While this is a small project, I could use the practice.
 -> Improved error handling.
  -> Since I'm trying to improve upon the reliability of a current
        tool, error handling is kind of important.
